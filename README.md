## Introduction

Brute-force attacks are cybersecurity techniques used to gain unauthorized access to systems or accounts by systematically trying all possible combinations of passwords or authentication credentials. In the context of this project, we focus on demonstrating a "DICTIONARY ATTACK" type of brute-force attack on an API.

## Features

- **Brute-Force Script**: The repository contains a Python script that performs a dictionary attack on an API by systematically trying a list of possible passwords.

- **Educational Purpose**: This project is intended for educational purposes and to raise awareness about the importance of robust API security.

- **Customizable**: The script can be modified and adapted for different APIs or use cases.

## Brute Force Attack
The script in this project is designed to perform a dictionary attack on an API. A dictionary attack involves systematically trying a list of potential passwords, often generated from common words or phrases.

Please use this script responsibly and only on systems or APIs for which you have explicit permission to test security.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you'd like to contribute improvements, features, or provide ethical hacking insights, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

   ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   
4. Make your changes and commit them:

   ```bash
    git commit -m "Add your feature or fix description"
   
5. Push your changes to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name

6. Open a pull request on the original repository, explaining your changes.
7. Collaborate with the community to review and improve your code.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations
Brute-force attacks, even for educational purposes, can have legal and ethical implications. Ensure that you have explicit permission to test security on any system or API before using this script.
